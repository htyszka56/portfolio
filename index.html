    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Education:</h3>
    <p>I recently completed my Master of Arts in Economics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
      My thesis focused on identifying the effects of light rail transit investment on real estate values 
      and neighbourhood income dynamics in Houston, Texas. Prior to UBC, I completed my Bachelor's of Business Administration
      at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario. </p>
    <h3>Areas of Interest:</h3>
    <p>I am passionate about cities, the built environment, and especially transportation infrastructure. I believe that cities are the driving forces for solutions in
      sustainability, innovation and economic opportunity, and I enjoy learning about how they can be improved to increase the quality of life for residents. 
      I continue to work on projects related to further building my knowledge of the transportation sector and its effects on building stronger communities.</p>
