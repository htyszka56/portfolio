    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I recently completed my Master of Arts in Economics at the University of British Columbia. Academically and professionally, I am passionate
      about cities, the built environment, and especially transportation infrastructure. I believe that cities are the driving forces for solutions in
      sustainability, innovation and economic opportunity, and enjoy learning about how they can be improved to increase the quality of life for residents.
      My thesis centered around this topic and focused on identifying the effects of light rail transit investment on real estate values and neighbourhood income dynamics in Houston, Texas. 
      I continue to work on projects related to further building my knowledge of the transportation sector and its effects on building stronger communities.</p>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Housing and Income Effects of Rapid Transit Expansion: Evidence from Houston's Green and Purple Lines</h3>
      <p><em>July 2025</em></p>
      <p>Evaluated the effects of Houstonâ€™s METRORail Green and Purple Lines on housing prices and incomes using hedonic and spatial difference-in-differences methods.
        Identified a positive effect on housing capitalization that decays with increased distance from newly opened stations. Capitalization effects were
        stronger during the construction phase of the project, rather than the post-opening period, suggesting housing market participants are forward looking as to
        the future benefits of increased transit connection. Leveraged extensive property tax assessment and transfer datasets, US Census data and QGIS analysis to construct econometric regression models.

      <h3>Research Proposal: Vehicle Emission Outcomes of the New York City Congestion Pricing Program</h3>
      <p><em>April 2025</em></p>
      <p>Conducted a preliminary analysis of the New York City Congestion Pricing Program and its effects on reducing particulate matter emissions
        within the metropolitan area. Collected air pollution data and developed an event study regression model to investigate the impacts over time,
        and compare changes in pollution between and within major US metropolitan areas.

      <h3>Effect of Hurricane Harvey on Wages and Employment in Texas</h3>
      <p><em>December 2024</em></p>
      <p>
        Investigated whether US counties that have greater exposure to hurricanes experience differing levels of employment and wage rates.  
        I hypothesized that larger and more productive companies and individuals with greater wealth would choose to locate outside of 
        high hurricane-risk areas.  Similarly, businesses affected by frequent hurricanes may spend more effort repairing and rebuilding than
        expanding and growing their operations, which could suppress employment and income growth.

      <h3>An analysis of Grand River Transit in Waterloo Region, Ontario</h3>
      <p><em>In progress</em></p>
      <p>
        In response to a recent article in the Waterloo Region Record calling for more individuals over the age of 25 to take transit, I am
        undertaking a research project to understand why this group is not currently using transit. I have conducted a thorough analysis in QGIS
        of the distribution of different age groups and income earners throughout the region, and have overlayed transit map data to understand the 
        overlap between transit and the desired clientele. I will write a report recommending some actions that can be taken to increase the use of
        transit by higher income earners outside of the student category in the region.
