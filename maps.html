        <h3>Artistic map of the city of Toronto</h3>
        <img src="portfolio\\images\\toronto_gg_map.png" alt="City of Toronto" width="600">
        <p>I have used OpenStreetMap data and Inkscape to create this map of the city of Toronto, focusing on the downtown core
        and the Toronto islands.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Transit lines and desired riders in Waterloo Region</h3>
        <img src="portfolio\\images\\wanted_transit_users.png" alt="GRT Wanted Transit Users" width="600">
        <p>Using QGIS, OpenStreetMap, Canadian census and GRT shapefile data, I have mapped neighbourhoods in Waterlo Region
            with higher incomes and share of population over 25 against the frequent bus network operated by GRT.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Houston current and projected LRT network</h3>
        <img src="portfolio\\images\\Houston city map with metro lines.png" alt="Houston Metro Lines" width="600">
        <p>For my thesis at the University of British Columbia, I have mapped the existing and proposed light rail metro lines 
            in Houston, Texas. Using METRORail shapefile data and OpenStreetMap, this map was used to analyze changes in housing prices
            and income along newly built rail corridors.

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Income changes in transit-adjacent neighbourhoods in Houston</h3>
        <img src="portfolio\\images\\income_change_map_1mile.png" alt="Transit-adjacent income changes" width="600">
        <p>Using US census data, I have analyzed changes in census tract level incomes in Houston across the time frame during which
            additional transit lines were constructed.
