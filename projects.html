      <h3>Housing and Income Effects of Rapid Transit Expansion: Evidence from Houston's Green and Purple Lines</h3>
      <p><em>July 2025</em></p>
      <p>I evaluated the effects of Houstonâ€™s METRORail Green and Purple Lines on housing prices and incomes using hedonic and spatial difference-in-differences methods.
        I Identified a positive effect on housing capitalization that decays with increased distance from newly opened stations. Capitalization effects were
        stronger during the construction phase of the project, rather than the post-opening period, suggesting housing market participants are forward looking as to
        the future benefits of increased transit connections. I Leveraged extensive property tax assessment and transfer datasets, US Census data and QGIS analysis to construct econometric regression models.

      <h3>Research Proposal: Vehicle Emission Outcomes of the New York City Congestion Pricing Program</h3>
      <p><em>April 2025</em></p>
      <p>I conducted a preliminary analysis of the New York City Congestion Pricing Program and its effects on reducing particulate matter emissions
        within the metropolitan area. I collected air pollution data and developed an event study regression model to investigate the impacts over time,
        and compare changes in pollution between and within major US metropolitan areas.

      <h3>Effect of Hurricane Harvey on Wages and Employment in Texas</h3>
      <p><em>December 2024</em></p>
      <p>
        I investigated whether US counties that have greater exposure to hurricanes experience differing levels of employment and wage rates.  
        I hypothesized that larger and more productive companies and individuals with greater wealth would choose to locate outside of 
        high hurricane-risk areas.  Similarly, businesses affected by frequent hurricanes may spend more effort repairing and rebuilding than
        expanding and growing their operations, which could suppress employment and income growth.

      <h3>An analysis of Grand River Transit in Waterloo Region, Ontario</h3>
      <p><em>In progress</em></p>
      <p>
        In response to a recent article in the Waterloo Region Record calling for more individuals over the age of 25 to take transit, I am
        undertaking a research project to understand why this group is not currently using transit. The purpose of this project is to develop
        and understanding of how to use QGIS to analyze a spatial problem, and to also sharpen my abilities to break down a problem into its component
        parts and formulate a holistic solution. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have conducted a thorough analysis in QGIS of the distribution of incomes and age groups across the Waterloo Region to isolate for the
        desired commuters according to The Record article.  I have then overlayed GRT data outlining the transit routes and stops and computed network
        distances from neighbourhoods to places of interest across the region to compare the transit and driving experience. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have recommended that the GRT and constituent cities of the Region of Waterloo take holistic actions, including increasing transit frequencies,
        improving the waiting environment, adjusting routing and updating fare box technologies to increase transit ridership.
      </p>
      <p>
        The included PDF is a current working draft of my research paper.
